# Jumbo-bier-scraper
This is a python scraper for a specific part of a site. I had never worked with python before so I did this just to practice. 

I used a scraper framework called Scrapy for python. It was really easy to use and if I ever need to make a scraper with python again I would use it again. 

All this scraper does is scraping all crates of beer. 

It retrieves the following: 
- name of product
- price of product (original price)
- link to the product page
